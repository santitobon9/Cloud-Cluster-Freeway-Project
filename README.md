# Cloud-Cluster-Freeway-Project
For this project, our team of three developers set up and managed a Mongo database of Trimet freeway data.
The goals of this project were:
- To introduce ourselfs to concepts and aspects that are specific to cloud-sacle data management systems.
- To acquire practical experience with cloud-scale data management system like Mongodb.
- To gain experience what a real-world data team would accomplish in their day to day work. This means understanding the system and its capabilities. Designing a data model and implementing that model and providing a final report with results.

For this project we:
- Extracted, tranformed and loaded freeway data from csv format into Mongo collections.
- Designed schemas and optimized quieres for the freeway database.
